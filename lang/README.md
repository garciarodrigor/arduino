Arduino and lang capabilities test
==================================

* rgb.(c|h) : This example demonstrates a way to achieve the information hiding 
(encapsulation) aspect of Object-Oriented Programming using the C language. If 
someone wanted to change the declaration of struct rgb, it would be unnecessary 
to recompile any other modules in the program that use the rgb.h header file 
unless the API was also changed. [Opaque pointer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer)
